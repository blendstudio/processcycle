# Process Cycle

This is a collection of scripts that automates the software process cycle.

### Development Environment Setup

    $ processcycle dev

Downloads the development environment softwares and installs the stable releases.

### Initial Setup

    $ processcycle init

This option will retrieve the source code from repository, install required software
(dependencies) and do the needed configurations. After this steps, run the node module
should be enougth to get a working project:

    $ npm start

### Source Code Test

    $ processcycle test

This option will **update the source code** and **validate it** by runnning its tests. 
*If source code is invalid*, output of the failing steps should be prompted to the user.

### Source Code Deploy

    $ processcycle deploy

It runs **$ processcycle test**. *If source code is valid*, the script will compress the 
source code folder, genereta a hash for the compressed folder file, log that hash into a
file, then remove the compressed file and merge the source code deployed.

### Check Source Code Deploys

    $ processcycle check $1

If **$1** is empty, this option will check the last deployed source code by running **$ processcycle deploy**'s
subroutines, without the merge operation. The hash generated should be equal to the hash logged. If **$1** was 
given, then **$1** deploys will be checked.

To check all deploys:

    $ processcycle checkall
